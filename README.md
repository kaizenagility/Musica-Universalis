# Musica-Universalis

First project at Per Scholas -- Create a page about a subject you're passionate about!

I love math and art, and the book by theoretical physicist Frank Wilczek: "A Beautiful Question"

## Flexbox Navbar

We just learned how to use Flexbox with CSS. I created a navbar based on the Fibonacci sequence, where each list item flexes to the next number in the Fibonacci sequence:

I used a CSS animation to create a solar eclipse. When we learn javascript for audio controls, I want to learn how to make the audio stop when the moon completely covers over the sun.

## Golden Ratio Footer

Here, the footer uses flexbox once again to keep a responsive ratio of 1.612 to 1 -- the Golden Ratio. The platonic solid shapes are contained in these bouncy border boxes, and I would like each one to play a harmonic interval on hover.

The idea is to create a "space instrument" that corresponds to Pythagoras' ideas of the "music of the spheres"

Pythagorean harmony: http://www.phys.uconn.edu/~gibson/Notes/Section3_7/Sec3_7.htm

When I learn more javascript skills, I would like to create this "space instrument" using a WebGL three.js animation of the solar system, with harmonic ratios between the planets that correspond to the Pythagorean imagination.

## Frank Wilczek

This project is an homage to my most recent favorite book and its beautiful author:
